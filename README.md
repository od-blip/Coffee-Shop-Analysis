### Data Sources

Coffee Shop Data: The primary dataset used for the analysis is the **"coffeeshopdata.xlsx"** file containing detailed information about each sale made by the coffee shop.

---

### Tools

- MS Excel
  - [Download here](http://microsoft.com)
---

### Data Cleaning and Preparation

In the provided Excel file, there are three sheets: **Orders**, **Customers**, and **Products**, each containing relevant data for our analysis. To make the data more useful for analysis and charting, I first created relationships between the tables based on `Customer ID` and `Product ID`.

**Imported Columns:**
1. From **Customers** sheet: `Customer Name`, `Country`, `Loyalty Card`.
2. From **Products** sheet: `Coffee Type`, `Unit Price`, `Roast Type`, `Size`, `Profit`.

**Total Sales Calculation:**
1. Created a new column, **Total Sale**, by multiplying the `Quantity` by `Unit Price`.

**Steps in Power Query:**
1. **Date Handling**: Extracted the year from `Order Date` to create a new **Year** column for analyzing sales trends.
2. **Sorting**: Sorted the `Total Sale` column from largest to smallest and rounded the data in `Unit Price` and `Total Sale` to two decimal places for consistency.
3. **Handling Missing Data**: Replaced empty cells in the `Email` and `Phone` columns in the **Customers** sheet with "Null".
4. **Postcode Format**: Changed the `Postcode` column to **Text** to accommodate both alphanumeric (Ireland and UK) and numeric (US) postcodes, avoiding errors.

### Analysis and Charts

The goal was to gain key insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance.
The following analyses were carried out using Pivot Tables and various charts for visual representation:

1. Total Sales by Coffee Type

-  Chart: Bar Chart

Reason: A bar chart is ideal for comparing the sales performance of each coffee type. This chart makes it easy to see which coffee types generate the most revenue.

- Table

|Coffee Type|Sum of Total Sale (USD)|
|-----------|-----------------------|
|Exc        |12306.39               |
|Lib        |12054.1                |
|Ara        |11768.41               |
|Rob       |9005.17             |
|**Grand Total** |**45134.07**               |

3. Total Sales by Country

-  Chart: Pie Chart

Reason: A pie chart helps to show the proportion of total sales that come from different countries. This is useful for understanding the geographical distribution of customers.

-  Table

|Country	     |Sum of Total Sale (USD)|
|-------------|-----------------------|
|United States	|35638.74
Ireland	|6696.84
United Kingdom	|2798.49
**Grand Total**	|**45134.07**|
---
4. Total Quantity Sold by Coffee Type

-  Chart: Bar Chart

Reason: This chart gives a clear picture of which coffee types are the most popular based on the quantity sold, even if they donâ€™t necessarily generate the most revenue.

-  Table

|Coffee Type	|Sum of Quantity|
|--------------|---------------|
|Ara	|947
Rob	|878
Exc	|872
Lib	|854
**Grand Total**	|**3551**
---
5. Profit by Year

Chart: Line Chart

Reason: A line chart is excellent for showing trends over time. Here, it visualizes the profit trend across different years, helping to identify the most and least profitable periods.


6. Customer Segmentation Based on Loyalty

Chart: Doughnut Chart

Reason: This chart shows the percentage of sales made by loyalty cardholders versus non-loyalty customers, providing insight into how effective the loyalty program is.


7. Seasonal Sales Trends (Quarterly)

Chart: Line Chart

Reason: The line chart displays quarterly sales trends, helping to identify any seasonality in the coffee shopâ€™s business, such as high or low sales periods.


8. Sales by Coffee Size

Chart: Pie Chart

Reason: This pie chart breaks down total sales by coffee size, revealing which sizes are most popular with customers.

### Data Analysis and Formulas used

The following formulas are used:

XLOOKUP
``` XLOOKUP
=[@[Product ID]],products!A:A,products!E:E)
```

TOTAL SALES
``` TOTAL
=QUANTITY*UNIT PRICE
```

TRIM
```TRIM
=TRIM(start cell:end cell)
```
---

### Results and Findings

The analysis results are as follows:
1. **Top Customer Contribution**:
   - **Wilmore** is the coffee shopâ€™s top customer, contributing the most to overall sales. This customer alone generates a significant portion of the revenue, highlighting their importance to the business.

2. **Loyalty Program Insights**:
   - Sales from customers **without a loyalty card** make up **53%** of total sales, slightly higher than sales from loyalty cardholders, who account for **47%**.
   - The loyalty program is performing well, but there is room for improvement in encouraging more customers to join and engage with it.

3. **Popular Coffee Sizes**:
   - The **2.5-liter** size is the most popular, accounting for **53%** of sales. Other sizes lag behind: 
     - **1-liter** (24%)
     - **0.5-liter** (16%)
     - **0.2-liter** (7%)
   - Customers are heavily gravitating toward larger sizes, presenting an opportunity for further promotion of this size or boosting sales of smaller ones with targeted deals.

4. **Geographical Sales Distribution**:
   - **79%** of total sales come from **US customers**, making the US market critical for the coffee shop.
   - **Ireland** contributes **15%** of sales, while the **UK** accounts for **6%**. This suggests opportunities for growth in these regions with localized marketing efforts.

5. **Yearly Profitability Trends**:
   - **2021** was the most profitable year for the coffee shop.
   - However, **2022** has seen a drop in revenue, likely because the yearâ€™s data ends in August (the third quarter). 

6. **Coffee Type Performance**:
   - **Ara** is the best-selling coffee in terms of quantity, but **Roast Type EXC** generates more revenue despite having lower sales volume. This indicates that while **Ara** is popular, the higher-priced **EXC** roast is more profitable.

7. **Customer Segmentation Based on Loyalty**:
   - The loyalty program has helped in retaining a considerable number of customers, but additional strategies could be implemented to boost its impact, such as exclusive rewards or promotions for loyalty members.

8. **Seasonal Sales Trends**:
   - Sales fluctuate by quarter, showing some seasonality in demand. This pattern can be leveraged by planning targeted promotions during slower quarters to boost sales.

### Recommendations:
- **Engage High-Value Customers**: Personalized deals or loyalty incentives could retain top customers like Wilmore and increase their lifetime value.
- **Boost Loyalty Program Participation**: Further engagement with loyalty members and driving sign-ups among non-loyalty customers can increase repeat purchases.
- **Capitalize on Coffee Size Preferences**: With the 2.5-liter size dominating, promotions could focus on this size, while smaller sizes could be bundled or discounted to drive sales.
- **Expand into New Regions**: Targeted efforts in Ireland and the UK could help grow the coffee shop's presence outside the US.
- **Profit Optimization**: Promoting high-margin products like **Roast Type EXC** can boost overall profitability despite lower sales volume.

By addressing these insights, the coffee shop can optimize its sales strategy, deepen customer relationships, and improve profitability.

### Limitations Encountered During the Analysis

1. **Incomplete Data for Certain Fields**:
   - **Issue**: Some fields, particularly in the **Customers** sheet (e.g., `Email` and `Phone Number`), contained missing values.
   - **Impact**: This limited the ability to perform a full customer segmentation analysis or personalized marketing insights based on contact information.
   - **Solution**: Missing values were replaced with "Null" in Power Query, but ideally, the coffee shop should ensure that more complete customer data is collected at the time of purchase or registration.

2. **Postcode Format Variability**:
   - **Issue**: The `Postcode` field contained both numeric and alphanumeric formats, depending on the country (numeric for the US, alphanumeric for the UK and Ireland).
   - **Impact**: This caused inconsistency in data types, requiring manual adjustment to text format for uniformity.
   - **Solution**: Changing the data type to text addressed the issue, but it highlighted a challenge in handling global customer data where formatting standards differ. In the future, data entry validation or standardization could minimize these discrepancies.

3. **Sales Data for 2022**:
   - **Issue**: Sales data for 2022 was incomplete, only covering up until August (third quarter).
   - **Impact**: This limited the ability to make a full-year comparison and may have skewed seasonal analysis or profit trends for the year.
   - **Solution**: While insights were drawn from the available data, having full-year sales would provide a clearer understanding of the 2022 performance.

4. **Customer Segmentation by Loyalty**:
   - **Issue**: While I was able to segment customers by loyalty card status, there were no further insights available regarding customer purchasing frequency, average order value, or customer lifetime value (CLV) apart from total sales.
   - **Impact**: This limited the depth of customer behavior analysis and the ability to recommend detailed loyalty strategies.
   - **Solution**: Future analysis could benefit from more detailed customer transaction history to calculate metrics like average order value, CLV, and purchasing patterns over time.

### Conclusion on Limitations
While the analysis provided valuable insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance, addressing the above limitations would enhance the depth and accuracy of future analyses. Data completeness, more granular time series data, and external market context could greatly benefit the coffee shop's decision-making process.
